# Supplemental methods

## Mathematical model

This model was initially developed as a reference model for the COVID-19 hospitalisation nowcast challenge in Germany in 2021 and 2022 @Wolffram2023. It uses preliminary case count and their delays in the form of reporting triangles, and uses empirical delay distributions to estimate yet-to-be-observed cases. Probabilistic nowcasts are generated using a negative binomial model with means from the point nowcast and dispersion parameters estimated from past nowcast errors. Below, we describe the mathematical details of each component of the model, starting with a definition of the notation used throughout.

### Notation

We denote $X_{t,d}, d = 0, .., D$ as the number of cases occurring on time $t$ which appear in the dataset with a delay of $d$. For example, a delay $d = 0$ means that a case occurring on day $t$ arrived in the dataset on day $t$, or on what is considered to be the first possible report date in practice. We only consider cases reporting within a maximum delay $D$. The number of cases reporting for time $t$ with a delay of at most $d$ can be written as:

$$X_{t, \le d} = \sum_{i=0}^d X_{t,i} $$

A special case of this is the "final" number of reported cases at time $t$, $X_t$:

$$
X_t = X_{t, \le D} = \sum_{i=0}^D X_{t,i}
$$

Conversely, for delays less than the maximum delay $d < D$, we defined $X_{t,>d}$ by

$$X_{t,>d} = \sum_{i = d+1} ^{D} X_{t,i}$$

representing the number of cases still missing after $d$ delay. We refer to $X_t$ to describe a random variable, $x_t$ for the corresponding observation, and $\hat{x}_t$ for an estimated/imputed value. The matrix of $x_{t,d}$ available at a given time $t^*$ is referred to as a reporting matrix. In the case where all $t+d>t^*$ have yet to be observed (e.g. $t^*$ is the current time), this reporting matrix is referred to as the reporting triangle, with all values in the bottom right corner of the triangle being missing, except for the first entry at $x_{t=t*, d = 0}$.

|   | $d = 0$ | $d = 1$ | $d=2$ | $...$ | $d= D-1$ | $d= D$ |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| $t=1$ | $x_{1,0}$ | $x_{1,1}$ | $x_{1,2}$ | $...$ | $x_{1,D-1}$ | $x_{1, D}$ |
| $t=2$ | $x_{2,0}$ | $x_{2,1}$ | $x_{2,2}$ | $...$ | $x_{2,D-1}$ | $x_{2, D}$ |
| $t=3$ | $x_{3,0}$ | $x_{3,1}$ | $x_{3,2}$ | $...$ | $x_{3,D-1}$ | $x_{3, D}$ |
| $...$ | $...$ | $...$ | $...$ | $...$ | $...$ | $...$ |
| $t=t^*-1$ | $x_{t^*-1,0}$ | $x_{t^*-1,1}$ | $x_{t^*-1,,2}$ | $...$ | $x_{t^*-1,,D-1}$ | $x_{t^*-1,D}$ |
| $t=t^*$ | $x_{t^*,0}$ | $x_{t^*,1}$ | $x_{t^*,2}$ | $...$ | $x_{t^*,D-1}$ | $x_{t^*, D}$ |

### Delay distribution estimation

#### Estimate of the delay distribution from a reporting matrix

We can use a reporting matrix to compute an empirical estimate of the delay distribution, $\pi_d$. The empirical delay distribution, $\pi_d$ can be computed directly from the reporting matrix $X$ using the latest $N$ reference times via:

$$
\pi_d= \frac{\sum_{t=t^*-N+1}^{t=t^*} X_{t,d}}{\sum_{d'=0}^{D} \sum_{t=t^*-N+1}^{t=t^*} X_{t,d'}}
$$ {#eq:pi_d}

Where the numerator is the sum of all the observations across reference times $t$ for a particular delay $d$ of interest, and the denominator is the sum across all reference times $t$ and indexed delays in the reporting matrix $d'$.

#### Multiplicative model

In the case where we have missing values in the bottom right (i.e. we have a reporting triangle), the estimator $\pi_d$ can only be evaluated as written in \@ref(eq:pi_d) after discarding all data from the last $D-1$ time points. In order to use the partial information contained in the most recent $D-1$ time points, we use a different representation of the delay distribution via terms of the form:

$$
\theta_d = \frac{\pi_d}{\pi_{\le d-1}}
$$ {#eq:theta_d}

Where $$
\pi_{\le d-1} = \sum_{d'=0}^{d-1} \pi_d
$$ {#eq:pi_less_than_d}

These $\theta_d$ can be estimated via the equation above \@ref(eq:theta_d) and translated to $\pi_1,...,\pi_D$ via the recursion

$$
\pi_{\leq d} = (1+\theta_d)\pi_{\leq d-1}
$$ Subject to the constrain that $\sum \pi_i = 1$.

In this cases, we are imputing \$x\_{t=6, d = 2}\$ and \$x\_{t=5, d= 2}\$ assuming that the ratio between \$x\_{t=1:4, d = 2}\$ (block top), and \$x\_{t=1:4, d=0:1}\$ (block top left) holds for for \$x\_{t=5:6, d = 2}\$ (block bottom) and \$x\_{t=5:6, d = 0:1}\$ (block bottom left). In this example, \$\\hat{x}\_{t=6, d = 1}\$ has already been imputed using the same approach, and we treat it as known going forward. This process is repeated across the reporting triangle to estimate all values outlined in the dashed lines.](schematic_fig.png){#fig1} <!--Noting that this caption should probably be written to refer back to theta and pi_d. My understanding is that theta is basically block top/ block top left, and we get block bottom by assuming the equivalence of  block top/block top left = block bottom/ block bottom left. -->

The method requires at least one observation, at delay $d=0$ for the most recent reference time, located at the bottom left of the reporting triangle in Figure \@ref(fig1) above.

The intuition behind the multiplicative method is the assumption that the values at each delay $d$ for the recent times, will consist of the same proportion of the values previously reported for earlier times. To fill in the missing values for each column $d$, we sum over the rectangle of completely observed reference dates for all $d-1$ columns (block top left) and sum over the column of completely observed reference dates for all of the entries in column $d$ (block left). The ratio of these two sums, $\theta_d$, is assumed to be the same in the missing entries in column $d$, so we use the entries observed up to $d-1$ for each incomplete reference date (block bottom left), and scale by this ratio to get the missing entries in column $d$. This process is repeated for each delay from $d$ up to the maximum delay $D$. At each iteration an additional reference time entry is computed as the delay $d$ increases.

The delay distribution is estimated from the filled in reporting matrix per \@ref(eq:pi_d). It is worth noting that the resulting imputed values in the bottom right of the reporting triangle do not have an effect on the delay distribution, as they are chosen such that they correspond almost precisely to the distribution seen in the combination of the complete and partial rows. The slight imprecision is due to the additional component incorporated to handle 0s in observations of $x_{t>t^*-d, d}$. See [Zero-handling](#zero-handling-approximation) for further details.

### Point nowcast generation

To obtain a point nowcast matrix from a reporting triangle and any arbitrary delay PMF, $\pi_d$, we need to estimate the expected total number of eventual observed cases $\hat{x}_t$, for each reference time $t$. Let $x_{\leq t^*-t}$ be the sum over all delays $d$ that have already been observed (up until $t^*-t$), such that $x_{\leq t^*-t} =\sum_{d=1}^{d=t^*-t} x_{t,d}$ and $\pi_{\leq t^*-t}$ be the cumulative sum of the delay distribution, $\pi_d$ up until $d = t^*-t$ such that $\pi_{\leq t^*-t}= \sum_{d=1}^{d=t^*-t} \pi_d$. It can be shown (See [Zero-handling](#zero-handling-approximation) below) that the expected value of $X_t$, the total number of reported cases on reference time $t$, can be written as:

$$
E(X_t | x_{\leq t^*-t}, \pi_{\leq t^*-t}) = \hat{x}_t = \frac{x_{\leq t^*-t} + 1 - \pi_{\leq t^*-t}}{\pi_{\leq t^*-t}}
$$

Then we can compute $\hat{x}_{t,d}$ directly using the $d$th element of $\pi_d$

$$
\hat{x}_{t,d} = \pi_d \times \hat{x}_t
$$

Where the number of reports at timepoint $t$ with delay $d$ is the product of the the expected total reports, $\hat{x}_t$ and the proportion expected at that particular delay $d$, $\pi(d)$.

### Uncertainty estimation

To estimate the uncertainty in the nowcasts, we use past nowcast errors. In this analysis, we assume a negative binomial observation model.

#### Generation of retrospective reporting triangles

We describe a method which generates retrospective reporting triangles to replicate what would have been available as of time $t^*=s^*$, where $s^* = t^*-m$ for $m = 1, 2, ... M$ to generate $M$ retrospective reporting triangles.

To generate the set of $M$ reporting triangles, we work backwards from most recent to oldest, removing the last $m$ rows of the existing reporting triangle, to generate $M$ truncated reporting triangles. We then replace the bottom right of the triangle with NAs, assuming these would not have been observed as of $s^*$, to generare $M$ retrospective reporting triangles.

The method uses each retrospective reporting triangle to re-estimate a delay distribution using the $N$ preceding reference times of the retrospective reporting triangle before $s^*$, and recomputes a retrospective point nowcast matrix, for $M$ realizations of the retrospective reporting triangle (so $M$ different $s^*$ values).

Thus in order to estimate uncertainty using $N$ reference times, the total training volume must meet or exceed $N+M$ so that the oldest retrospective nowcast dataset at $s^* = t^*-M$ can use $N$ reference times for its point nowcast.

#### Generation of retrospective point nowcast matrices

From the $M$ reporting triangles, we apply the method described above to estimate a delay distribution from a reporting triangle and generate a point nowcast for each reporting triangle, to generate $M$ point nowcasts.

#### Fit predicted point nowcast vectors and observed counts to a negative binomial observation model at each forecast horizon

We quantify the uncertainty in the component of the target that corresponds to the counts that are still to be added. The default in the package assumes that the target is the final count at each reference time, summed across reporting delays, however, for the COVID-19 case study, the target is defined as the 7-day rolling sum of the counts at reference time, and therefore the uncertainty is quantified in the component of this quantity that has yet to be observed as of each reference time.

At each retrospective nowcast time $s^*$, we compute the predicted and corresponding observed nowcast at each forecast horizon $j = 1, ..., D$ by summing across the reporting delays for all delays $d$ that have been observed as of time $t^*$, as indicated below by the indicator function. We define the predicted nowcast for forecast horizon $j$ at retrospective nowcast time $s^*$ $$
\hat{X}_{t-j}(s^* >d) = \sum_{d=0}^{D} \hat{X}_{t-j,d}(s^*) \times I(t-j+d \leq t^*)
$$ and likewise the observed nowcast for forecast horizon $j$ at retrospective nowcast time $s^*$ $$
X_{t-j}(s^*\leq d) = \sum_{d=0}^{D} X_{t-j,d}(s^*) \times I(t-j+d \leq t^*)
$$

This generates $M$ pairs of predicted nowcasts and observed nowcasts for each forecast horizon $j = 1, ..., D$. We assume that the observed nowcasts $X_{t-j}$ follow a negative binomial observation model with a mean of $\hat{X}_{t-j}(t^*-j)$

$$
X_{t-j} | \hat{X}_{t-j}(t^* - j) \sim \text{NegBin}(\mu = \hat{X}_{t-j}(t^*-j) + 0.1, \phi = \phi_{j})
$$ for all $s^* = 1, ..., M$.

We add a small number (0.1) to the mean to avoid an ill-defined negative binomial. This generates a vector of negative binomial dispersion parameters indexed starting at forecast horizon $j=1$.

### Probabilistic nowcast generation

Using the dispersion parameters for each forecast horizon, $\phi(j),$ for $j = 1,...D$, we can generate probabilistic nowcast matrices by drawing samples from the negative binomial:

$$
X_{t^*-j} \sim NegBin(\mu = \hat{X}_{t^*-j}, \phi = \phi(j))
$$

We can sample for any number of draws, and then use the draws to compute any desired quantiles to summarize the outputs.

### Description of KIT simple nowcast implementation issue and revised nowcasts

When verifying the KIT simple nowcast implementation, we noticed that the code used to generate the KIT simple nowcasts in real-time contained an additional indexed element in the delay PMF for all counts observed beyond the maximum delay thus far. In the generation of retrospective nowcasts, these values were being handled as having been observed as 0s, when in fact they had yet to be observed in all of the retrospective nowcasts. This resulted in a comparison of a 0 to a later observed value – which has the impact of inflating the dispersion estimates, and may explain why the KIT simple nowcast method in Wolffram et al. [@Wolffram2023] overcovers relative to the other methods. In the latest implementation in the RESPINOW Hub [@respinow_hub_2025], the authors have removed the density beyond the maximum delay column from their implementation, and thus it no longer contains this issue.

In order to validate our `baselinenowcast` method against a revised version with the bug fixed, we regenerated the nowcasts using the pre-processed reporting triangle in the German Nowcast Hub repository [@hospitalization_nowcast_hub_2025] and generated retrospective nowcasts, referring to these in the main text and supplement as the KIT simple nowcast revised.
